# CAD Ultrasound Renal Diagnosis

## Abstract of the work 

In this project we propose the development of a renal ultrasound computer aided tool using deep learning techniques. We introduce three main tools as part of this system: a classifier that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to distinguish between healthy and pathological kidneys, a segmentation tool substantiated on mask region based CNNs >>(mask-RCNNs) to locate the kidney, and a tool for estimating the area of the parenchyma, using another segmentation model and blob detection, while also returning the kidney size using blob detection to find a pixel-to-centimiter conversion. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these tools using efficientNets<< (REESCRIBIR) and ResNets for the classification task and performing visual evaluation of the segmentation and area estimation tools. Additionally we develop an application programming interface (API) for local usage and testing. Our results suggest that the proposed system has the potential to improve the efficiency of renal ultrasound diagnosis.
